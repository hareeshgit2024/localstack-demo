# Local Stack #

## Overview ##

LocalStack is an open-source tool that provides a fully functional local AWS cloud stack for testing and development purposes. It allows developers to simulate the AWS cloud services on our machines, enabling faster and cost-effective testing without using real AWS resources. LocalStack covers a wide range of AWS services like S3, Lambda, DynamoDB and many more. It is mainly useful for developers working on serverless applications and cloud-native architecture as it hellps rapid iteration and debugging. By setting AWS environment locally, LocalStack helps ensure that applications behave consistently when deployed to the actual AWS cloud.
